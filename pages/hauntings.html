            <h2>The Phantom Miner of Ghost Rock</h2>
            <h3>Legend has it that deep in the hills near Ghost Rock lies the spirit of a miner named Jebediah Harper,
            who perished in a tragic mine collapse in the early 1900s. They say that on moonless nights, a ghostly figure with a miner's 
            lantern roams the area, swinging his pickaxe and mumbling about his lost gold. Those who have tried to follow the light end up 
            disoriented, hearing whispers calling their names or feeling cold hands brush against them. Locals warn to stay clear on foggy 
            nightsâ€”Jebediah doesn't like company.</h3>

            <h2>The Lady of Sand Hollow Reservoir</h2>
            <h3>Before Sand Hollow was a reservoir, it was said to be the site of a homestead belonging
            to a reclusive woman named Agatha. After she vanished mysteriously, people reported eerie occurrences, especially near the water's edge.
            Campers tell tales of a spectral figure in a white dress wandering the shores, humming an old lullaby and leaving no footprints behind.
            Sometimes, just as dawn breaks, her ghostly form can be seen looking out across the water, her gaze fixed as if waiting for someone who never came back.</h3>
